✅📄⚠️❌

✅ store jwt on client side upon authentication w/cookies:
✅ add image-path & images to script tags in html pages:
  ✅ index (home)
  ✅ login
  ✅ admin home
✅ setup home admin page on vite config
✅ in admin login page:
  ✅ call verify serverless function, & if successful, redirect to home page
✅ redirect user to home admin page on authentication

✅ add mongo schema for products


- create admin home page: 
  ✅ debug main flex bug
  ✅ ensure user is authenticated:
    ✅ redirect user to login page if not authenticated
  ✅ wait for verification function before fetching from db & rendering html:
    ✅ create a serverless function that fetches all menu items from db, grouped by category
  - on data fetch:
    ✅ create a li.category_title inside ul.menu_categories for every category
    ✅ create an a:link with an href property set to `#${category.toLowerCase()}`, and text set to the category
    ✅ append the a tag to the li tag
    ✅ append the li tag to ul#category_navk
    ✅ complete #menu_section: 
    - at the end of each category, create an article#[`add$_{category.toLowerCase()}_item`], with "add <category> item" text

- debug admin home style on desk (after collapsing nav media query):
  📄 nav misalignment occurs only after data is rendered:
  ✅ prevent items from rendering, and see if anything occurs when the item nav is rendered, to rule out the item nav
  - add styles to page from scratch; if any styles are conflicting from global, remove from global css
  - compare the styles of the major elements (header, nav, main) between admim home & contact (in order to make the main tag vertically scrollable without making the whole page horizontally scrollable):
    - header
    - nav
    - main

  - create editable fields for:
    - menu items:
      ✅ add a few menu-items to get a feel for the layout
      ✅ add real menu items in db
      - add a default "add item" div to every section (in js, as this will depend on how many food categories there are)
    - store hours


- test page to ensure nothing broke:
  - seems good on mine. Will test on firefox in deploy, & will ask Khanh/Phuong to test on Mac.
